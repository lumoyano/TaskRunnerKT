# TaskRunnerKT
Kotlin CLI to learn the basics of the language in a task helper type of application
# Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a small, object-oriented console application in Kotlin. My goal was to build a tool that helps organize and execute grouped mechanical tasks—like vehicle maintenance—by breaking them into subtasks and detailed steps.

Each task contains subtasks, and each subtask is made up of individual steps, each with its own instruction, tool, and tip. The system helps visualize and print a complete checklist to guide users through their work, with tips and tool lists.
